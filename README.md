## Description

Did you know that you can use Chef Inspec to validate that your application is developed, delivered, and remains secure and compliant across all aspects of the DevOps infinity loop? Inspec is the only single tool that satisfies security and compliance in all phases of DevOps.

In this White Board & Demo session, I will demonstrate and talk about how to utilize Chef Inspec for OS and Application Compliance, regardless of how you deliver your application.

Progress Chef is still build in under the Apache 2 Open Source licenses and (most) everything shown can be done with our commercial product as well as the community build from our source code.
